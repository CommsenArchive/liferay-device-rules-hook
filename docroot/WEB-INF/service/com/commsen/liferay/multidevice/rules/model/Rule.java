/**
 * The model interface for the Rule service. Represents a row in the &quot;MultiDevice_Rule&quot; database table, with each column mapped to a property of this class.
 *
 * <p>
 * Never modify this interface directly. Add methods to {@link com.commsen.liferay.multidevice.rules.model.impl.RuleImpl} and rerun ServiceBuilder to automatically copy the method declarations to this interface.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Never reference this interface directly. All methods that expect a rule model instance should use the {@link Rule} interface instead.
